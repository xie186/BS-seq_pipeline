## Labs (or people) using ML (DL) in Biology

[Brendan J. Frey](http://genes.toronto.edu/?q=home)

The Frey Lab develops techniques that use large scale datasets to derive predictive models of how genes and many other genomic features act in combination to produce genetic messages that control cellular activities. We have most recently focused on applying deep learning to model "cell variables" and understand human diseases (Science, 2014; Nature Biotechnology 2015; Proceedings of the IEEE, 2015). The group is led by Brendan J. Frey, who has appointments in Engineering and Medicine. If you are interested in joining the group, click here.


[AVANTI SHRIKUMAR](https://stanford.edu/~avanti/index.html)

Ph.D student in the Department of Computer Science at Stanford, advised by Professor Anshul Kundaje. I develop broadly-applicable methods to make deep learning models interpretable, and have applied these methods to study regulatory genomics. You can find a preprint describing our first algorithm on arXiv here.

I have a Bachelor's in Computer Science with Molecular Biology from MIT and spent a year working as a developer for the Healthcare team of Palantir Technologies before starting my PhD.
