## Labs using ML (DL) in Biology

[Brendan J. Frey](http://genes.toronto.edu/?q=home)

The Frey Lab develops techniques that use large scale datasets to derive predictive models of how genes and many other genomic features act in combination to produce genetic messages that control cellular activities. We have most recently focused on applying deep learning to model "cell variables" and understand human diseases (Science, 2014; Nature Biotechnology 2015; Proceedings of the IEEE, 2015). The group is led by Brendan J. Frey, who has appointments in Engineering and Medicine. If you are interested in joining the group, click here.
